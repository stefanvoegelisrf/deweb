# Name generator
The purpose of this name generator is to generate given names for creatures that I have drawn

## Rules to create a name
I want to base the name generator based on a set of rules to create given names.

### Prefixes
**Prefixes** in given names are often used to create variations of a name or to honor heritage. For example, "Mc" in "McKenzie" or "Fitz" in "Fitzgerald".

### Suffixes
**Suffixes** in given names can indicate diminutive forms or gender. For example, "-son" in "Jackson" or "-ina" in "Christina".

### Phonetic Patterns and Phonetic Appeal
**Phonetic patterns** in given names involve the use of sounds that flow well together. **Phonetic appeal** means the name is pleasant to hear and easy to pronounce, like "Liam" or "Ava".

### Phonemes
**Phonemes** are the distinct units of sound in a name that may affect its uniqueness and pronunciation. For instance, the difference in sound between "Ethan" and "Nathan".

### Syllable Structure
The **syllable structure** in given names can vary from simple, like "Mae" (one syllable), to complex, like "Alexander" (four syllables).

### Morphological Structure
**Morphological structure** in given names refers to how different parts of a name are put together, such as "Al-" and "-bert" combining to form "Albert".

### Semantic Meaning
**Semantic meaning** in given names pertains to the significance or origin of the name, which can be derived from ancestors, virtues, or nature, like "Dawn" or "Ethan" (meaning strong, firm).
