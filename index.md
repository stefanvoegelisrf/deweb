Todays topic were mostly repetition, which is why I focused on recreating a first poster and animate it with css. I chose a poster of Josef Müller-Brockmann of his series "Musica viva". This was an easy example and allows for playful experimentation.

Regarding the font choice, I used Roboto, as it is similar to Akzidenz-Grotesk, which Brockmann uses. See: [github.com - Josef Müller-Brockmann Essay](https://williamipark.github.io/IXD102-Josef-Muller-Brockmann-Essay/index.html)

The implementation was easy, but also a bit challenging, as I am not an expert with CSS animations. I had some issues with the positioning of the elements before and after the animation. The state of the element can be controlled with the css `animation-fill-mode`. By setting this to `forwards` or `backwards`, we can choose what state the element should have after the animation is finished. As I wanted to have an animation that only plays once, to make the elements appear, this was necessary.

While implementing the poster, I came across a valuable resource for css animations: [codepen.io - CSS Animation](https://codepen.io/nelledejones/pen/gOOPWrK)

Another helpful resource for CSS animations is also [w3schools - CSS Animations](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp)

I have also created a version of the fabulouscss excercise, which can be found here: [fabulouscss](tag1/fabulouscss/)
An important an helpful resource here was, how to import Google Fonts purely with CSS, as we were not allowed to change the html. See: [w3docs.com - how to import Google fonts in CSS file](https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/css/how-to-import-google-fonts-in-css-file.html)

We were given a handful of useful visual inspiration, which is listed below:
